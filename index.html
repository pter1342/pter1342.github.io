    <h3>Junior software engineer</h3>
    <p>Something little about me: as you've read above this text, I've introduced myself as a junior software engineer. Which is a bit misleading, as I have not advanced that far (yet!). In order to improve my skills, I will relentlessly study and work on myself to reach that lofty goal one day.</p>

    <p>As I am running words to say, I just want to wish you a happy stay or look upon this beautiful little website I've created definitely not a day before the start of this course.</p>
